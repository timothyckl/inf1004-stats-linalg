	\item  In a sample of 20 people the times taken, in seconds, to solve a simple numerical puzzle
	      were as follows:

	      \begin{center}
		      \begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c}
			      17 & 19 & 22 & 26 & 28 & 31 & 34 & 36 & 38 & 39 \\

		      \end{tabular}
	      \end{center}

	      \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		      \item Calculate the mean and standard deviation of these times.
		      \item In fact, 23 people attempted to solve this puzzle. However, 3 of them failed to solve it within the allotted time of 60 seconds, taking 62, 65 and 97 seconds respectively.\\[0.5cm] Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) of the times taken by all 23 people.
