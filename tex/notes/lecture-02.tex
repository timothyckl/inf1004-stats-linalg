\section{Types of Probability}
Probability is defined as a number in the range $[0,1]$ that is assigned to an event associated with a random experiment. There are two interpretations of probability theory that guide how such values are assigned:

\subsection{Classical Probability}
In classical probability, all outcomes in the sample space are assumed to be equally likely.\\
The probability of a random event $A$ occuring is given as $$P(A)=\frac{\text{Number of different outcomes in A}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$$
\textbf{\textit{Note:}} This definition is not very practical for everyday life because it assumes the outcomes are equally likely.

\subsection{Empirical Probability}
In empirical probability theory, the probability of an event $A$ occurring  approximated by the relative frequency of its occurrence over a large number of trials such that $$P(A)=\frac{\text{Number of times an outcome occurs}}{\text{Total number of observations}}$$
This interpretation relies on collecting data over the years or existing historical data to propose such relative frequencies.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We define a sample space $S$ as the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon.
	\item An event $A$ is defined as the set of outcomes under investigation.
	\item By definition of probability, the following statements must hold to be valid: $$0 \leq P(A) \leq 1,\ P(S)=1$$
	\item If $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are mutually exclusive events, then $$P\!\left(\bigcup_{i} A_i\right) = \sum_{i} P(A_i)$$.
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Complementary Events}
The complement of an event $A$ denoted $P(A^c)$ and is given by $$P(A^c) = P(S) - P(A)$$

Conceptually, the complement of an event can be thought of as the probability that it does not occur. Visually, this can be represented as the area in a venn diagram that is not in $A$.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		% Sample space S
		\draw[thick, fill=gray!30] (0,0) rectangle (6,4);
		\node at (0.2,4.3) {$S$};

		% Event A
		\draw[thick, fill=white!30] (3,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);
		\node at (3,2) {$A$};

		% Complement label
		\node at (5,3) {$A^{c}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\section{Intersection of Events}
Given two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of their intersection denoted $$P(A \cap B)$$ is the probability that both events occur. In a venn diagram, it is the area where both events overlap.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		% Sample space
		\draw[thick] (0,0) rectangle (6,4);
		\node at (0.2,4.3) {$S$};

		% Circles/ellipses outlines (unfilled)
		\draw[thick] (2,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);
		\draw[thick] (4,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);


		% Shade intersection only (clip trick)
		\begin{scope}
			\clip (2,2) ellipse (1.79cm and 1.19cm);
			\fill[gray!35] (4,2) ellipse (1.79cm and 1.19cm);
		\end{scope}

		% Labels
		\node at (1.1,2) {$A$};
		\node at (4.9,2) {$B$};
		\node at (3,2) {$A \cap B$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

If two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then $P(A \cap B) = 0$ because both events never overlap.

%------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Union of Events}

Given two events $A$ and $B$, the \emph{union} of these events, denoted $A \cup B$, is the event that \emph{at least one} of the events occurs. That is, $A \cup B$ occurs if event $A$ occurs, or event $B$ occurs, or both occur.\\[0.2cm]
In terms of probability, $P(A \cup B)$ represents the probability that at least one of the two events occurs. Visually, in a Venn diagram, the union corresponds to the total area covered by both events $A$ and $B$.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
		% Sample space
		\draw[thick] (0,0) rectangle (6,4);
		\node at (0.2,4.3) {$S$};

		% Filled union region
		\fill[gray!40] (2,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);
		\fill[gray!40] (4,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);

		% Event outlines
		\draw[thick] (2,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);
		\draw[thick] (4,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);

		% Labels
		\node at (1.1,2) {$A$};
		\node at (4.9,2) {$B$};
		\node at (3,2) {$A \cup B$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In general, the probability of the union of two events is given by
\[
	P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).
\]

This formula accounts for the fact that the overlapping region $A \cap B$ is included in both $P(A)$ and $P(B)$, and therefore must be subtracted once to avoid double counting.

\medskip

\subsection{Mutually Exclusive Events}
If events $A$ and $B$ are \emph{mutually exclusive}, then they cannot occur at the same time. In this case,
\[
	P(A \cap B) = 0,
\]
and the formula simplifies to
\[
	P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B).
\]

%------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Conditional Probabilities}
In practice, it happens naturally that probability of an event $A$ can be changed if additional information is available, which leads to the discovery/creation of \emph{conditional probability}.

\subsection{Definition}
The conditional probability of event $A$ given that event $B$ has occurred, denoted $P(A \mid B)$, is defined (for $P(B) > 0$) as $$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$$

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]

		% Sample space
		\draw[thick] (0,0) rectangle (6,4);
		\node at (0.2,4.3) {$S$};

		% Event B (conditioning event)
		\fill[gray!30] (4,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);
		\draw[thick] (4,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);

		% Event A
		\draw[thick] (2,2) ellipse (1.8cm and 1.2cm);

		% Intersection A ∩ B
		\begin{scope}
			\clip (4,2) ellipse (1.79cm and 1.19cm);
			\fill[gray!60] (2,2) ellipse (1.79cm and 1.19cm);
		\end{scope}

		% Labels
		\node at (1.1,2) {$A$};
		\node at (4.9,2) {$B$};
		\node at (3.1,2) {$A \cap B$};

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\textbf{\textit{Note:}} Conditional probability is \emph{not symmetric}. In general,
\[
	P(A \mid B) \neq P(B \mid A),
\]
because the events $A$ and $B$ may have different probabilities and provide different information when conditioned upon.

\medskip

Additionally, when working with conditional probability $P(A \mid B)$, the sample space is no longer the original sample space $S$. Instead, the sample space is restricted to event $B$. All probabilities are therefore measured \emph{relative to $B$}.


%------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Multiplicative Rule of Probability}

The definition of conditional probability provides a way to compute the intersection of events $A$ and $B$. Since,
\begin{align*}
	P(A \mid B) & = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \\
	P(B \mid A) & = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}.
\end{align*}

We have that,
\begin{align*}
	P(A \cap B) & = P(A \mid B) \cdot P(B), \\
	P(A \cap B) & = P(A \mid B) \cdot P(A).
\end{align*}

%------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Independent and Mutually Exclusive Events}

\subsection{Independent Events}

Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be \textbf{independent} if
\[
	P(A \cap B) = P(A)\,P(B).
\]

Equivalently, provided the relevant probabilities are non-zero,
\[
	P(A \mid B) = P(A)
	\quad \text{or} \quad
	P(B \mid A) = P(B).
\]

That is, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. Using the definition of conditional probability,
\[
	P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B)\,P(B).
\]
If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A \mid B) = P(A)$, and hence
\[
	P(A \cap B) = P(A)\,P(B).
\]

This result is known as the \textbf{multiplication rule for independent events}.

\medskip

More generally, if $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are mutually independent events, then the probability that all events occur is
\[
	P\!\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right)
	= \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i).
\]
